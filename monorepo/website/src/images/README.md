# Images

## Guidelines for profile images

- **Aspect ratio**: Images should be square (1:1 ratio)
- **File format**: Prefer WebP or JPG. PNG is also acceptable if other formats are not possible
- **Naming convention**: Use camelCase for file names (e.g., `firstNameLastName.jpg`)
- **Optimization**: No need to compress or optimize images - Astro automatically converts them to WebP and handles optimization during build
