SeqSets (pronounced _seek-set_) are collections of sequences indicated by their Pathoplexus accession numbers, which provide unique identifiers that can be used to reference that set of sequences. 

They can also be used to generate [DOIs](https://www.doi.org/the-identifier/what-is-a-doi/), which can be used to reference that collection of sequences.
This is particularly useful in publications, where putting the DOI into the reference list (like a paper or other cited resource), will allow tracking of which publications sequences are used in.

DOIs and SeqSets can also be used to give credit to sequence generators and share the sequences used in any analysis, whether a social media post, blog post, or in personal communications.
