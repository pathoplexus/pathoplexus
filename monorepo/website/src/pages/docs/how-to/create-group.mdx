If your organization does not yet have a group on Pathoplexus, you can create one. 

If they already have a group, please do not create another! Contact someone in that group and ask them to add you using your Pathoplexus username.

Please remember that everyone within a group is able to submit, edit, and revoke sequences uploaded by anyone else in that group. Read more about that [here](/docs/how-to/add-remove-user-group).

1. Log into your account and enter your account page by clicking 'My account' in the top-right corner of the webpage

3. Fill in the required information about your group
4. Click 'Submit' to create your group

You can now add members to your group by following the steps [outlined in the docs](/docs/how-to/add-remove-user-group).
