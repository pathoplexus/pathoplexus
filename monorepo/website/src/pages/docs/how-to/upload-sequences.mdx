You can only upload sequences if you have [created an account](create-account) and are part of a [group](create-group).

Before you begin this process, you should ensure your data is in the correct format. Each sequence should have a unique submissionID that can be used to associate it with its corresponding metadata entry.

Loculus expects:

- Sequence data in `fasta` format with a unique submissionID per sequence.
- Metadata in `tsv` format for each sequence. You can read more about the required metadata fields [here](../concepts/metadataformat). If you need help formatting metadata we offer a metadata template for each organism on the submission page.

_You can try out uploading sequences to our [Demo Instance](https://demo.pathoplexus.org/) - it works just like the 'real' Pathoplexus, but is wiped regularly and **no data is sent onward to INSDC**. We also have some [example data](https://pathoplexus.github.io/example_data/) you can upload to the Demo Instance._


### Multi-segmented Pathogens

Pathoplexus expects multi-segmented pathogens to have one unique submissionID per **isolate** (pathogen sample containing all segments). However, `fasta` files should still have a separate entry/record per segment. Therefore, each record id should include the unique submissionID of the isolate and the segment name, for example: `submissionID + '_' + segmentName`. The metadata is uploaded per isolate, i.e. there will be only one row for each `submissionID` and segmented metadata parameters need to be uploaded individually, i.e. under `length_{segmentName}` etc.

## Website

Uploading sequences via the website is a very way to submit sequences without having to worry about any code.

1. Log into your account, and then click 'Submit' in the top-right corner of the website
2. Select the organism that you'd like to submit sequences for
3. Drag-and-drop a `fasta` file with the sequences and a metadata file with the associated metadata into the box on the website, or click the 'Upload a file' link within the boxes to open a file-selection box
4. Select the Terms of Use that you would like for your data. You can read more about the **Terms of Use** [here](/about/terms-of-use/data-use-terms). If you choose 'Restricted' - set the time limit for the restriction, up to 1 year
5. Select 'Submit sequences' at the bottom of the page

The data will now be processed, and you will have to approve your submission before it is finalized. You can see how to do this [here](approve-submissions).

_Detailed API instructions for submitting sequences will come soon, but you can read our [authentication token how-to](/docs/how-to/authentication-api) and [Swagger API documentation](/api-documentation) if you're an experienced user._

{/* ## API

**By using our API you agree to our [Data Use Terms](/about/terms-of-use/data-use-terms).**

For full instructions on how to upload sequences via our API, you should read our [Swagger API documentation](/api-documentation).
Before using our API endpoint, you will need to generate an [authentication token](/docs/how-to/authentication-api).

As a brief introduction into using the API, you should be sure you have on-hand:

- The `fasta` file of sequences you wish to submit
- Matching metadata file
- The abbreviation for the organism you're submitted sequences of:
  - `cchf` (CCHF)
  - `ebola-sudan` (Ebola Sudan)
  - `ebola-zaire` (Ebola Zaire)
  - `west-nile` (West Nile)
- Your submitting Group ID (click on the group from 'My account' to see this)
- The Data Use Terms you wish to submit under, `OPEN` or `RESTRICTED`
  - If `RESTRICTED`, the date until which they are restricted (up to 1 year from today) in format `YYYY-MM-DD`

You can then construct your API submission query. */}
