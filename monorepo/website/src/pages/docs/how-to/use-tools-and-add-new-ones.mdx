## Using the Tools menu

The sequence search page contains a **Tools** dropdown that lists external
applications that can be launched with the sequences in your search query or any that you select. Select some sequences (or just make a search), open the
dropdown and choose a tool. You will be taken to the tool in question which will be supplied with URLs so that it can seamlessly retrieve the sequences you are looking for from Pathoplexus.

Initial tools allow you to:
- perform QC on sequences with Nextclade and see them on a tree (for some organisms)
- visualise the geographic distribution of your sequences

## Configuring a new tool to be added to Pathoplexus

We are interested in adding new useful external tools to this menu. If you are a developer of tools interested in having your tool featured here, please read on.

### Requirements

For a tool to be integrated into the Pathoplexus tools menu, it must be able to:

- Accept file URLs as parameters in its web address
- Automatically fetch and process the files from these URLs and do something useful with them

When users select your tool from the Tools menu, Pathoplexus will generate download URLs, configured in a way that you specify, then redirect users to your tool with these URLs embedded in the web address. Your tool needs to parse these URLs from its incoming request and retrieve the files directly from Pathoplexus.

### Adding your tool to Pathoplexus

The list of tools is defined in the `linkOuts` section of the `values.yaml`
configuration of Pathoplexus.

A link-out entry has the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "My Tool",
  "url": "http://example.com/analysis?data={{[unalignedNucleotideSequences]}}",
  "maxNumberOfRecommendedEntries": 100
}
```

`name` is displayed in the menu, `url` is a template that may contain
placeholders and `maxNumberOfRecommendedEntries` is optional. When this value is
set, users will be warned if they attempt to send more sequences than the limit
suggests.

### URL template placeholders

The URL template may contain placeholders wrapped in square brackets. They are
replaced with download links generated for the current search results. Available
placeholders are:

- `[unalignedNucleotideSequences]` – link to the unaligned FASTA file.
- `[alignedNucleotideSequences]` – link to the aligned FASTA file.
- `[metadata]` – link to a metadata table in TSV format.

Each placeholder can be extended with options:

- `:[segment]` – restricts the sequence download to a specific segment, e.g.
  `[unalignedNucleotideSequences:S]`.
- `+rich` – include rich FASTA headers when supported, e.g.
  `[unalignedNucleotideSequences+rich]`.
- `|format` – request a specific data format such as `json`, e.g.
  `[metadata|json]`.
- For metadata, `+col1,col2` can be used to include only
  certain fields, e.g. `[metadata+country,host]`.

To ensure parts of the URL are properly URL encoded, wrap them in double curly
braces. For example `{{my query}}` becomes `my%20query` after processing. This
encoding happens after any placeholders are substituted, so `{{[unalignedNucleotideSequences]}}` will become a properly URL-encoded URL to access the unaligned nucleotide sequences. You can even doubly-nest `{{}}` syntax where necessary.

Multiple placeholders can appear in a single URL, allowing you to pass both
sequence and metadata downloads to an external tool.

You can create a PR to add your link-out entries to the configuration under a specific organism, or raise an issue to suggest this.
