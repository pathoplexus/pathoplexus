When creating a new Pathoplexus account, you can choose to either login with an existing ORCiD or create a separate account. If you use ORCiD, your account will be linked with Pathoplexus and we will pull some information from ORCiD, such as your ORCiD and name - but will never receive or access your password. In the future, you can always login using ORCiD and don't need a separate password.

If you choose to create your own account, you will need to create a password, much like with other websites, and will need to add your ORCiD manually if you would like to link it (highly recommended to track authorship most effectively).

To begin creating a new account, click 'Login' in the top-right on the website.

> **Important:** Each username and email address can only be used once.
>
> Usernames or email addresses from disabled accounts cannot be reused.

To login with ORCiD:
1. Create 'ORCiD' to the right-hand side of the page, login to ORCiD, and authorize access to your account
2. You'll then be redirected back to Pathoplexus to complete your account creation
3. On the new page, you'll be able to edit and complete the information needed for your account
4. When you press 'Submit' you will be sent an email to verify your account (valid for 5 minutes). You won't be able to log in until you verify your account
5. When you click on the verification email you'll automatically be logged in to your new account


To login by creating your own account:
1. Click 'Register' at the bottom of the login page to create a new account
2. Fill in the required user account information, including username, email, and password
3. You will need to agree to the [Data Use Terms](/about/terms-of-use/data-use-terms) to create an account
4. When you press 'Submit' you will be sent an email to verify your account (valid for 5 minutes). You won't be able to log in until you verify your account
5. When you click on the verification email you'll automatically be logged in to your new account
