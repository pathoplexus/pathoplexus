You can easily view sequences that are awaiting approval/release, or that have been released.

To do this, click on 'Browse' in the top-right menu, then select the pathogen you're interested in. To see sequences that are awaiting approval click 'Review' (you can then [edit](/docs/how-to/edit_submissions) and [approve](/docs/how-to/approve_submissions) these sequences). To see sequences that have been released, click 'View'.
