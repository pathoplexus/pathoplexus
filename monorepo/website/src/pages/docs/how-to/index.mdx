Our 'How To' pages provide a useful guide to some of the most common things you might want to do at Pathoplexus, from [creating an account](/docs/how-to/create-account) to [searching for sequences via API](/docs/how-to/search-download-seqs-api).

Use the menu on the left to navigate through a list of topics that you might be curious about - or need help figuring out! - and hopefully we can quickly get you using Pathoplexus like a pro.

You can also find out [how to report suspected issues with sequences](/docs/how-to/report-sequence-issues) and [how our curators evaluate reported problems](/docs/how-to/curator-sop).
