Sequences can be revoked if they contain errors that cannot be corrected.
You can read more about the circumstances under which sequences could/should be revoked in the [Revocation](/about/governance/data_submission#81-revocation) section of the Data Submission and Processing document.

Note that revoking a sequence **does not delete it**.
While it will not turn up in default searches, and will be clearly marked as revoked, it will still be publicly visible.

Deletion is generally _not_ permitted by Pathoplexus, since this is intransparent and causes confusion when a record cannot be traced.
Read more about Deletion and the circumstances when it may be appropriate (such as identifiable data, or data submitted without permission)
in the [Deletion](/about/governance/data_submission#82-deletion) section of the Data Submission and Processing document. 

### How to revoke a sequence

Revocation can only be done by members of the group that originally submitted that sequence. 

- Find the sequence you would like to revoke via searching the main database, or by viewing your submitted sequences.
(Go to 'Submit' and 'View sequences').
- Scroll to the bottom of the sequence page and find the 'Revoke this sequence' button in the bottom-left corner.
- Confirm you want to revoke the sequence
- You will be taken to the sequence review page - press 'Release' to release the revoked sequence
- Confirm you want to release the sequence

The sequence is now revoked.
