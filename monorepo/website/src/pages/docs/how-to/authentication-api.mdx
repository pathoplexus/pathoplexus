Some of our endpoints require authentication in order to use them. In order to use these endpoints you need to get a JSON web token. You can obtain the token either by sending a request to our Keycloak authentication server or by retrieving the corresponding cookie from the browser.

The retrieved token expires after 10 hours.

## Send request with cURL

<InfoBox>
    To use the [demo instance](https://demo.pathoplexus.org) instead of the main instance, please replace `authentication.pathoplexus.org` with `authentication-demo.pathoplexus.org`.
</InfoBox>

The following script demonstrates how you can retrieve a token with a POST request using cURL. It only works if you use a simple username-password authentication. If you only use ORCiD for authentication and do not have a password, you need to add a password (see how to [edit your account](/docs/how-to/edit-account)). This solution also does not work if you activated two-factor authentication. In these cases, you can retrieve a token from the browser (see section below).

```bash
KEYCLOAK_TOKEN_URL="https://authentication.pathoplexus.org/realms/loculus/protocol/openid-connect/token"
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID="backend-client"

USERNAME_LOCULUS="MY_USERNAME_HERE"
PASSWORD_LOCULUS="MY_PASSWORD_HERE"

jwt_keycloak=$(curl -X POST "$KEYCLOAK_TOKEN_URL" --fail-with-body -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d "username=$USERNAME_LOCULUS&password=$PASSWORD_LOCULUS&grant_type=password&client_id=$KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID")
jwt=$(echo "$jwt_keycloak" | jq -r '.access_token')

echo "$jwt"
```

## Retrieve token from browser

After you have logged in on [pathoplexus.org](https://pathoplexus.org) (or [demo.pathoplexus.org](https://demo.pathoplexus.org) for the demo instance), an access token is stored in your browser as a cookie. The token is called `access_token` and you can manually retrieve it from the browser. Instructions on how to do it can be found in the documentation of the browsers: [Google Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/application/cookies), [Firefox](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/storage_inspector/index.html) and [Safari](https://www.cookieserve.com/knowledge-base/website-cookies/how-do-i-check-cookies-in-safari/).
