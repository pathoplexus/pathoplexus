You can edit your account to update your information anytime.
Once logged in, you can click on 'My account' in the top-right of the webpage

1. Click 'Edit email address or password'
2. This will redirect you to Keycloak, the component of our website that handles accounts and authentication
3. From here, you can edit your personal information, such as username, email, name, and password. At the moment, you cannot edit your ORCiD or affiliation/university
4. If you have signed up through ORCiD and do not have a password, you can set a password.
5. Be sure to save any changes after you make them.
6. You can also explore your login options such as 2-factor authentication, and see where else you're logged in and what other accounts are linked.
