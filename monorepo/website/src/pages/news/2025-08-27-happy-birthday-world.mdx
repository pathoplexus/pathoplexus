# Pathoplexus Turns One â€“ and Adds Measles Virus!

*By the Pathoplexus Team - 27 August 2025*

Today we celebrate the first anniversary of Pathoplexus! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‚

Since [launching on 27 August 2024](https://pathoplexus.org/news/2024-08-27-hello-world) with four pathogens â€“ Ebolavirus Sudan, Ebolavirus Zaire, West Nile virus, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus â€“ weâ€™ve grown further into the truly global, community-driven platform for transparent, equitable, and impactful pathogen sequence sharing that we strive to be.

## A Year of milestones

Over the past 12 months, together with our community, we have:

- **Expanded our supported pathogens** - adding [mpox in December 2024](https://pathoplexus.org/news/2024-12-09-expanding-pathoplexus-mpox), and [RSV & HMPV in May 2025](https://pathoplexus.org/news/2025-05-22-pathoplexus-rsv-and-hmpv), in response to community requests.

- **Enabled rapid, global sharing** - receiving direct submissions from 5 continents, including more mpox sequences in 2025 than any other database, and large RSV datasets from international collaborations.

- **Introduced major software improvements** - from [Excel metadata uploads](https://pathoplexus.org/news/2025-04-16-spring-update) and advanced search qualifiers, to [integrated "link-out" tools](https://pathoplexus.org/news/2025-07-14-july-update) for quick phylogenetic and geographic context.

- **Showed the importance of protected sequence sharing** - enabling rapid public health use while protecting publication rights, with uptake from partners in Africa and South America.

- **Engaged widely** - presenting Pathoplexus at WHO IPSN events, major scientific conferences, and workshops on data sharing, as well as featuring in [_Lancet Microbe_](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(24)00263-5/fulltext), [_Science_](https://www.science.org/content/article/new-scientist-run-virus-database-vows-be-transparently-run-and-simple-use), [_Nature_](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02864-x), and national media.

- **Received recognition** - including the [2024 Swiss National Open Research Data Prize](https://ord.akademien-schweiz.ch/news/offene-wissenschaft-ausgezeichnet-vier-projekte-erhalten-den-nationalen-preis-fuer-offene-forschungsdaten) for our commitment to openness and community governance.

All of this has been achieved while being powered largely by volunteer effort - a testament to the dedication of our development team, members, curators, and Executive Board.

## Welcoming Measles Virus to Pathoplexus

Weâ€™re excited to mark our first birthday by adding measles virus (MeV) as our newest supported pathogen!

Following strong community support and an [Executive Board resolution](https://pathoplexus.org/about/governance/minutes/2025-07-24_EB_Resolutions.pdf), Pathoplexus now offers streamlined, user-friendly MeV data submission, with the same sharing options as our other pathogens:

- **Open** - sequences are shared immediately with INSDC-member databases.
- **Restricted-Use** - sequences can be shared rapidly for public health use while reserving publication rights for up to 1 year.

Adding measles virus comes at a critical time:

- Measles cases have surged dramatically in the US this year, making real-time genomic tracking vital in North America.
- Global travel and declining vaccination rates in some regions are increasing the risk of further outbreaks worldwide.
- More labs than ever are generating full-genome MeV sequences, offering opportunities for deeper insights into transmission, introductions, and viral evolution.

We believe supporting rapid MeV sequence sharing will strengthen surveillance and research - and weâ€™re eager to work with the measles community to make this happen.

## Other Updates:

### New uploads:

- We were pleased to receive 256 new direct mpox sequence uploads, from [National Public Health Agency (NPHA), Ministry of Health, and Kenema Government Hospital, Sierra Leone](https://pathoplexus.org/mpox/search?visibility_releasedAtTimestamp=true&releasedAtTimestampFrom=1751984476&releasedAtTimestampTo=1751984478&isRevocation=&visibility_groupId=true&visibility_groupName=true&groupId=498); [National Health Agency (NPHA), Central Public Health Reference Laboratory, Institute de Pasteur de Dakar, Sierra Leone](https://pathoplexus.org/mpox/search?visibility_releasedAtTimestamp=true&releasedAtTimestampFrom=1755302400&releasedAtTimestampTo=1755464967&isRevocation=&visibility_groupId=true&groupId=499); [Instituto Nacional de Saude Doutor Ricardo Jorge (INSA), Portugal](https://pathoplexus.org/mpox/search?visibility_releasedAtTimestamp=true&releasedAtTimestampFrom=1752485599&releasedAtTimestampTo=1752485601&isRevocation=&visibility_groupId=true&groupId=265); [Helmholtz Institute for One Health, Greifswalt Germany and Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques, Cote dâ€™Ivoire](https://pathoplexus.org/mpox/search?visibility_releasedAtTimestamp=true&releasedAtTimestampFrom=1753192352&releasedAtTimestampTo=1753192354&isRevocation=&visibility_groupName=true&visibility_groupId=true&groupId=535); [Cliniques Universitaires de Kinshasa and Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale, DRC](https://pathoplexus.org/mpox/search?visibility_releasedAtTimestamp=true&releasedAtTimestampFrom=1751328000&releasedAtTimestampTo=1755160535&isRevocation=&visibility_groupName=true&visibility_groupId=true&groupId=232); [National Virus Reference Laboratory, University College Dublin, Ireland](https://pathoplexus.org/mpox/search?visibility_releasedAtTimestamp=true&releasedAtTimestampFrom=1754409203&releasedAtTimestampTo=1754409205&isRevocation=&visibility_groupId=true&visibility_groupName=true&groupId=463); and [Institut Pasteur de Bangui, Central African Republic](https://pathoplexus.org/mpox/search?visibility_releasedAtTimestamp=true&releasedAtTimestampFrom=1755182568&releasedAtTimestampTo=1755182570&isRevocation=&visibility_groupId=true&groupId=544)

- For West Nile, we received 308 sequences from [San Diego County Public Health Laboratory, California, USA](https://pathoplexus.org/west-nile/search?visibility_releasedAtTimestamp=true&releasedAtTimestampFrom=1755096672&releasedAtTimestampTo=1755096674&isRevocation=&visibility_groupName=true&visibility_groupId=true&groupId=547) and [University of Nebraska Medical Center, USA](https://pathoplexus.org/west-nile/search?visibility_releasedAtTimestamp=true&isRevocation=&visibility_groupName=true&visibility_groupId=true&groupId=548&releasedAtTimestampFrom=1754006400&releasedAtTimestampTo=1755734399)

### Grant success: 

- Weâ€™re incredibly happy to announce a successful small grant from "[ETH4D Research Challenge](https://eth4d.ethz.ch/funding-opportunities/eth4d-research-grants/ETH4D-Challenges.html)" as a partnership between ETH Zurich, Pathoplexus, and Stephen Kanyerezi in Uganda. The aim of ETH4D is to aid collaborations between ETH research groups, non-â€‹academic partners, and partners from low- and lower-middle â€‹income countries. Our grant will focus on further developing Pathoplexus and Loculus, creating workshops and training materials, gathering user feedback, and developing our community.

### Technical improvements:

- Itâ€™s now possible to add GISAID accessions to sequences uploaded to Pathoplexus to aid de-duplication efforts. Simply add the accession (either on initial upload, or in a revision later) to the `gisaidIsolateId` metadata field. (This is only available on organisms supported by GISAID.)

- Bulk selection made easier: You can now quickly select multiple sequences on the search page by clicking and dragging your mouse over the checkboxes â€”- no need to click each one individually.

- Links to sequences at any INSDC database: Pathoplexus now offers a dropdown menu on our links to INSDC accessions, allowing you to view sequences in your preferred INSDC partner databaseâ€”whether that's GenBank, ENA, or DDBJâ€”making it easier to work with the platform you're most familiar with.

- Find a sequence faster than ever by using our new expanding search icon at the top of the front page - just paste in a Pathoplexus accession and go straight there!
