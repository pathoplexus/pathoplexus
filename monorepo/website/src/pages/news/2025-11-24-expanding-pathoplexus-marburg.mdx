# Expanding Pathoplexus: Marburg added

*By the Pathoplexus Team - 24 November 2025*

Today, Pathoplexus launches an additional viral pathogen: Marburgvirus, a member of the Filoviridae family, which includes Ebola viruses. Marbugvirus contains both Marburg virus (MARV), and its close relative Ravn virus (RAVN). 
MARV in turn can be divided into two main clades: Marburg A and Marburg B. MARV causes [Marburg virus disease](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease) with a case fatality rate of 24% to 88%. The NIH ranks MARV as a [Category A Priority Pathogen](https://biosecurity.fas.org/resource/documents/NIAID_priority_pathogens-1-07.pdf). Pathoplexus aims to support sequence sharing to improve both understanding and response.

Our Executive Board decided to [prioritize adding Marburg](/about/governance/minutes/2025-11-27_EB_Resolutions.pdf) in light of the [recent outbreak in Ethiopia](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON585).

As with other organisms, you can share Marburgvirus data as "[Open](/about/terms-of-use/open-data)" immediately or specify that data be "[Restricted-Use](/about/terms-of-use/restricted-data)" for up to 1 year, before becoming Open. Restricted-Use data is still available but is restricted in how it can be used in publications or preprints. All Open data is sent on to INSDC-member databases.

We hope that by adding Marburg to Pathoplexus we can support the response efforts underway for the current outbreak, and in future outbreaks. In addition, we hope to continue expanding the pathogens that Pathoplexus can support in the future.
