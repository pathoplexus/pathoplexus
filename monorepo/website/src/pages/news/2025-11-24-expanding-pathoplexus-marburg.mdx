# Expanding Pathoplexus: Marburg added

*By the Pathoplexus Team - 24 November 2025*

Today, Pathoplexus launches an additional viral pathogen: Marburg. Marburg is a hemorrhagic fever virus of the Filoviridae family (the same family which includes ebola viruses). Viral strains fall into two main lineages Ravn and Marburg, Marburg in turn can be divided into two main clades Marburg A and Marburg B. Marburg virus causes [Marburg virus disease](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease) with a case fatality rate of 24% to 88%. The NIH ranks Marburg as a [Category A Priority Pathogen](https://biosecurity.fas.org/resource/documents/NIAID_priority_pathogens-1-07.pdf). Pathoplexus aims to support sequence sharing to improve both understanding and response.

Our Executive Board decided to prioritize adding Marburg (TODO: add link) in light of the [recent outbreak in Ethiopia](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON585).

As with other organisms, you can share Marburg data as "[Open](/about/terms-of-use/open-data)" immediately or specify that data be "[Restricted-Use](/about/terms-of-use/restricted-data)" for up to 1 year, before becoming Open. Restricted-Use data is still available but is restricted in how it can be used in publications or preprints. All Open data is sent on to INSDC-member databases.

Launching with these new pathogens is an achievement we’re proud of, and we hope to continue expanding the pathogens that Pathoplexus can support in the future.
