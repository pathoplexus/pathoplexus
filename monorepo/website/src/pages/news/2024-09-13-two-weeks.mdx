# Two Weeks of Pathoplexus

*By the Pathoplexus Team - 13 September 2024*

Since Pathoplexus launched on 27 August, we’ve been humbled by the incredibly positive reaction from the pathogen research, bioinformatics, and public health communities. And it’s been a busy two weeks! We’re thrilled so many people have taken the time to explore the website
 & [GitHub](https://github.com/pathoplexus/pathoplexus), read about our aims & commitments, and also helped spread the word about Pathoplexus!

Here’s a short list of updates from our side, to celebrate two weeks of being live!

- [Science Magazine’s Jon Cohen covered Pathoplexus](https://www.science.org/content/article/new-scientist-run-virus-database-vows-be-transparently-run-and-simple-use), getting some reactions from the community, and a deep-dive to answer some common questions (29 Aug 2024)
- [UniVadis’ Roberta Villa gave some history on pathogen data sharing](https://www.univadis.it/index.php/viewarticle/si-dice-villa-genomi-virali-nuova-piattaforma-garantire-2024a1000fx1) and how Pathoplexus might fit into the landscape (Italian, 3 Sept 2024)
- [BBC World Service’s Roland Pease spoke with Emma Hodcroft on Science in Action](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3ct5vd7) (starting at 8m30s) to find out more about Pathoplexus and what it aims to do (4 Sept 2024)
