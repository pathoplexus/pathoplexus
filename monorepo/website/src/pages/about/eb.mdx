# Pathoplexus Executive Board

Pathoplexus is run by an Executive Board, who have dedicated themselves to following the 
[Pathoplexus Values](/about/governance/values)
and aiming to ensure the Pathoplexus database is efficient, effective, transparent, and at the service of the pathogen genome sharing community.

Pathoplexus believes a diverse, active board is key to ensuring the database can maximise the good it does.
Our board is committed to serving in two-year terms, and is accountable to the Pathoplexus Membership.

The Pathoplexus Executive Board is defined and guided by the [Pathoplexus Statutes](/about/governance/pathoplexus-statutes) and [Executive Board Guidelines](/about/governance/eb-guidelines).
