# Summary
Open Data submitted to Pathoplexus is available for use without restrictions, subject to ethical guidelines and proper attribution. In the following, we state the main Data Use Terms for Open Data as a summary.

# Key Points
1. **Availability**: Open Data is freely accessible to all users.
2. **Usage**: Open Data can be used for any purpose, including unpublished work, publications, and preprints.
3. **Onward Submission**: Open Data is immediately submitted to International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) on behalf of the original submitters.
4. **Attribution**: It is highly recommended to acknowledge the data generators.

# Ethical Guidelines
Even though Open Data does not have specific formal restrictions, users are expected to:
- Use the data ethically and in accordance with scientific etiquette.
- Acknowledge data generators when appropriate.
- Consider seeking collaborations in appropriate circumstances.

# Data Acknowledgement
For publications and preprints:
- It is strongly encouraged to create a SeqSet of Pathoplexus accessions.
- Cite the DOI of the SeqSet in the References section of your manuscript.
- Consider additionally listing INSDC accessions for easy tracing on both platforms.

# Third Party Data Sharing
When sharing Open Data onward from Pathoplexus:
- Clearly communicate the Data Use Terms.
- Keep the Data Use Terms columns intact in the metadata.
- If displayed on a website or database, include a direct link to the original sequence page on Pathoplexus or an INSDC database.
