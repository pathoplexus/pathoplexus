    This summary is provided as a general guideline to the Restricted Data Terms of Use, but only the full terms are used to interpret, enforce, and arbitrate. For the full terms, and guidance, see the

# Summary
Restricted Data on Pathoplexus is subject to specific use conditions for a limited time period, up to one year after submission. Afterwards the data automatically becomes Open Data. In the following, we state the main Data Use terms for Restricted Data as a summary.

# Key Points
1. **Availability & Usage**: Restricted Data is freely accessible to all users, but with restrictions on how it can be used.
2. **Duration**: Data can be restricted for up to 1 year after submission, as set by the submitter.
3. **Onward Submission**: Restricted data is made available on INSDC after the restricted period ends.
4. **Attribution**: Data **must** be attributed according to the requirements detailed below.

# Usage Requirements

## Unpublished and Un-Preprinted Work
- Restricted data can be used for unpublished work (e.g., graphical representations, blog posts, reports).
- Data submitters **must** be acknowledged by providing accession numbers or using a SeqSet when using restricted data.
- Work **must** link back to Pathoplexus for original data and submitters.
- The institution and leading author(s) need to be credited if all sequences are from one institution.

## Publications and Preprints
- Use of restricted data often requires explicit permission from the Submitting Group.
- Users **must** create a SeqSet, generate a DOI, and cite it in the manuscript.
- Users need to specify the division of sequences into “Focal Set” and “Background Set” (see below, and full terms for details).

### Focal Set Use
- Sequences are part of the focal set if they are key to the analysis being performed: without these sequences the analysis would not be possible
- Usage requires either:
  1. Including one or more Submitters as an author on the manuscript, or
  2. Obtaining explicit written permission (“Authorship Waiver”) from the Submitting Group.

### Background Set Use
- Sequences are part of the background set if they could be replaced with other sequences with the same analysis outcome
- The Background set may be used without authorship or waiver, but careful consideration is required to determine if the sequences are background sequences.
- Users **must** create a SeqSet, generate a DOI, and cite it in the manuscript.

# Third Party Data Sharing
When sharing Restricted Data from Pathoplexus onward:
- Clearly communicate the Data Use Terms.
- Keep the Data Use Terms columns intact in the metadata.
- If displayed publicly, include a direct link to the original sequence page on Pathoplexus.
- If re-sharing Pathoplexus data as part of a database with many users, access restrictions may not be imposed

# Using All Data
To study general viral properties or patterns, such as mutation frequencies, across broad regions or globally, it is sometimes permissible to use all sequences for a pathogen as a “Background Set”.

- The dataset must contain contributions from many submitting groups
- Users **must** create a SeqSet containing all the data, generate a DOI, and cite it in the manuscript.

If only a few submitters have generated sequences for a pathogen, it’s unethical to use all sequences from that pathogen without contacting and involving those submitters.

# Ethical Considerations
- Avoid "scooping" others' work.
- Consider involving authors from regions where data originates.
- Ensure fair representation and genuine collaboration efforts.
