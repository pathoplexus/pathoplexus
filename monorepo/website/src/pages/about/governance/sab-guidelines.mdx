The Executive Board or secretariat will coordinate the organisation of the regular meetings. The Executive Board attends regularly scheduled Scientific Advisory Board meetings to present questions for feedback and hear the Scientific Advisory Board’s advice. However, the Scientific Advisory Board is authorized to call and organize their own meetings at any time, which may not necessarily include Executive Board members.

An agenda for each Scientific Advisory Board meeting, along with minutes of the previous meeting; information and data that is important to the Scientific Advisory Board’s understanding of the tasks to be conducted at the meeting, will be distributed to Scientific Advisory Board members one week in advance of the meeting so that meeting time may be focused on feedback and questions that the Scientific Advisory Board has about the materials. At regularly scheduled meetings, the Executive Board will prepare and disseminate the agenda and relevant materials, based upon items of discussion raised by the Executive Board and General Assembly. Minutes of past meetings, once approved by the Scientific Advisory Board, are shared with the General Assembly. If the Scientific Advisory Board schedules additional meetings without Executive Board attendance, they will prepare and disseminate their own agenda and materials, and approve and distribute their own minutes to the Executive Board within 1 month of a meeting. Certain matters may be discussed at the meeting without advance distribution of written materials as deemed appropriate.
