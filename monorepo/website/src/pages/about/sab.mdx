The Pathoplexus Scientific Advisory Board, made up of experts in virus genomics and data sharing, plays a crucial role in providing expert guidance to Pathoplexus decision-making, providing feedback to help ensure that the Pathoplexus database meets the needs of the scientific and public health communities and adheres to the [Pathoplexus Values](/about/governance/values). By sharing their expertise, the board helps maintain the database as a reliable and transparent resource for pathogen genome sharing.

Pathoplexus recognizes that a diverse and active board is essential for maximizing the database's positive impact. 

The Pathoplexus Scientific Advisory Board is defined and guided by the [Scientific Advisory Board Guidelines](/about/governance/sab-guidelines).
