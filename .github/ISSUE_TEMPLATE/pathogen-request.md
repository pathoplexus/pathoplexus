<!-- Please remember that Pathoplexus is primarily designed for human viral pathogens. Requests for non-viral and non-human pathogens will not currently be considered. -->

**Have you searched the issues to see if your pathogen has already been requested?**
Please do not open multiple requests per pathogen - duplicates will be closed. Instead, please add your support to an existing request - feel free to add more details or examples as well.

**What pathogen would you like to see included in Pathoplexus?**
Please be specific to at least species level, and further if applicable.

**Why should this pathogen be added to Pathoplexus?**
Please describe what added value and/or benefit would come from including this pathogen.

**What kind of community works on this pathogen?**
Please briefly describe the pathogen community. Where does this pathogen circulate globally? What regions/groups are key in sequencing/analyzing this pathogen? Is the community large or small; well-connected or dispersed?

**Additional context**
Please add any other information that will help us assess whether or not to prioritize adding this pathogen to Pathoplexus.

<!-- One of the most important factors we consider for adding a new pathogen is whether a significant part of the pathogen community supports adding it to Pathoplexus. Others can show their support for adding a pathogen by replying to this issue. -->
